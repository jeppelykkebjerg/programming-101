# Description
This is just me learning programming concepts and principles without formal education. This is a hobby project and is considered an eternal work-in-progress (WIP).

# Why?
I want to become a better programmer alngside my career in data engineering and data architecture.

# How?
I keep my notes and textual descriptions in Notion and link to this Github repo. I use python as my language of choice for programming examples.
